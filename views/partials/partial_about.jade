    h3 What is Tweetforce? 
    p Demandforce services small businesses and helps them market and grow locally. This is currently accomplished through cross-listing advertisements for local businesses to consumers searching for various services in the same area. Demandforce also helps customers (small businesses) manage their social media presence. The rough idea for the project is to scrape twitter for local consumers tweeting about an industry that a subscriber (business) to Demandforce operates in. This could be accomplished by identifying keywords in tweets and filtering by location. For example, if someone in the Plano area tweeted "Looking for a good gym, any suggestions?", Demandforce could flag the tweet and send it to their customers who operate fitness facilities in Plano. The businesses then have the opportunity to reach out to the potential customer and offer discounts or other incentives to secure that business. Demandforce could help to automate this process and allow clients to customize interactions with potential leads. This type of service could supplement the current social media and marketing efforts while still maintaining the focus on growing local businesses efficiently.
